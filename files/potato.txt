In the late  60's I was working for a company, in southern Michigan,
called Space Defense  Corp.   The   company  was  engaged  in  basic
research with most of the contracts being with NASA.   The  question
of particular interest  to us at the time was, "What would happen to
man's biological rhythms in a long term deep space flight?"

Man has about 280 biological clocks  ticking  away  and  are more or
less associated with the Planet Earth.  So if we take  man  and send
him into deep space, is he going to fall apart?

The plan was  to  take  something  simple,  study its' biorhythms on
earth, then shoot it into deep space,  then  compare  the biorhythm,
which would give you conjecture as to Man.  After a reasonable study
the Potato was  elected-it  was  simple, lots of data  in  the  data
banks, and the  life-blood of Americans. To help clarify the data we
elected to only fly the eye of a  potato  thus  reducing the size of
the experiment.

 Pertinent Data:

	 * Sample size - 1/4" diameter - 3/4" long potato eye plug.
	 * Oxygen consumption- 10 Cubic Inches in 90 days.
	 * Oxygen transducer was used to control the partial pressure
	 * Potato  chamber  was  constructed entirely  of  aluminum  to
	   preclude the  possibility of any Lumens being able to excite
	   the eye.
	 * The chamber was pressurized to one atmosphere and maintained
	   to one millionth of a PSI-this  is  so  the eye cannot sense
	   barometric changes.
	 * Ambient temperature was controlled to within three Degrees F

One of the  first  things  that  we noticed was that  not  all  eyes
survived the plugging  operation.  The potato eye would go into post
operative shock as if he were trying to decide if "He" were going to
live or die.  He would not take a  breath  for  2 or 3 days, but, if
the potato were plugged during the full moon the breathing would

start almost immediately.  Thus giving more credence to the "Farmers
Almanac" saying that "if you want  to  have  a  good potato crop you
should plant in the light of the full moon".

The first of the data showed that the potato would get up at sunrise
and "Work"; do his thing until sundown.  Then he  would  go  into  a
quasi-state of low oxygen consumption (sleep) until next morning.

Then the process  was  repeated  five  more  times followed by a low
oxygen consumption day ;"cool it day",  to put it more accurately he
worked six days and rested on the seventh!  Now this brought up more
questions than it solved. How is it that all potatoes  had  the same
rhythm?  Why were  they  synchronous?  When did they pick the day of
rest?  Was "GOD" trying to tell us something?

Over the years  of  study the potato  appeared  to  be  smarter  and
smarter.  While still  locked  up in the can,  he still  could  tell
Spring, Winter, Fall  and Summer.  He knew the days of the week, the
time of day and the position of the  moon  with  respect to the sun.
That potato either had a fantastic memory or was getting information
through the can.

We then decided to revise the instrumentation to put  a  temperature
probe directly into  the  potato eye.  We reasoned that as he took a
breath, the O2 would combine with  the  starch - this reaction would
produce heat thus telling us the minute the potato took a breath.

This new instrumentation presented us with some of  the old problems
of grounding, shielding,   and  stray  fields  each  in  turn  being
answered by perseverance, except one.

Sporadic problems that seemingly come  and go without an explanation
as to reason or time are the worst and hardest type  to correct. The
search seemed endless. Finally we noticed that when someone new came
into the lab that the potato got hyper.

That is to  say,  we  noticed  that the breathing rate increased and
would stay elevated for several minutes after the arrival of any new
people to the laboratory. Does this  sporadic problem turn out to be
Potato Memory?

Can the potato SEE through the aluminum can, remember who was in the
lab, then say to himself "that's a new face, what's  he doing here"?
Then after a few minutes, think to himself "nothing new is going on,
I guess I'll go back to doing my thing".

It's time for  some  conjecture,  what  if  the Potato were a super-
sensitive gravity field detector?   This  would  account for knowing
the Spring, Winter, Fall and Summer, further, the  position  of  the
sun and moon  could  be  accounted for.  But, knowing the day of the
week?

That's a reach, but not so much if  you consider everything produces
a gravity field.  That the net gravitometric force is the net of all
the fields around you.  When Jim, Betty, and Bob  are  in  the  lab,
they produce a net gravity field which is sensed by the Potato.  Now
lets say that Judy comes into the Lab. The gravity field must adjust
which will affect the Potato as well.

Let us take  this  one  more  step, the building that houses the lab
normally has about 100 people working there, but on Sunday there may
be none to five.  Which would give  a  lower net gravitational field
and thus the Potato does not feel the pressure to work so hard.  And
all this time you thought that He wanted to go to church.  One final
thought. If the Potato can't see why do we say he has eyes.

Vangard Note..

  This is  a  most intriguing proposition and fits  perfectly  well
  with the  research  done by Cleve Backster (Primary Perception in
  plants) and Herbert Veale's Homing  Conductance Ray (see HOMCOND1
  on KeelyNet).  The fact that the potato eye is being  kept  in an
  aluminum container (a Faraday cage) indicates three possibilities
  as to the nature of WHAT can pass freely through a Faraday cage?

  The first is obviously gravity as suggested in the text.

  The second  is  some  kind of SCALAR component as detailed in the
  file HOMCOND1.  Since all cells  have  DNA  and  DNA  consists of
  multiple loops (double helices) that create a scalar  "ray"  from
  each twist  of the helix, then each cell produces multiple "rays"
  that can be accessed with suitable detectors/emitters.

  The third possibility is that of  the flow of Aether (also called
  the "virtual field" or "hyperspace" or "tachyon field", etc.).

  Since all matter has centers through which this Aether flows, the
  degree and  "character"  (modulations)  of this inflowing  Aether
  could be  sensed  and "sniffed" as to WHAT IS IN the Aether wind.
  The idea  that Aether can be so  modulated  with  other  energies
  gives rise to device possibilities beyond belief.

  Another interesting aspect of this paper is with  the  potato eye
  KNOWING to skip the 7th day.  For several years now, we have been
  looking for  information  as  to  a set of "clocking" fields that
  control all mass and energy.  These fields would be inter-related
  and follow this pattern :

	  Universe which clocks
		 Nebulas which clock
			Galaxies which clock
			   Solar systems which clock
				  Planets which clock
					 Mass aggreations on the planet which clock
						Molecules of the aggregation which clock
						   Atoms of the molecules which clock
							  Inter-Atoms which clock
								 Unknown

  So, at the birth of each atom,  a  clock  is  established that is
  controlled by the larger clocks.  When the atoms  combine to form
  molecules, they  in  turn heterodyne to form the molecular clock.
  When the  molecules  combine to  form  mass  aggregations,  those
  molecules collectively   combine  to  form  a  heterodyned   mass
  aggregate clock.  (see the file NEUTRAL1.ZIP)  And so on...

  Each mass  therefore  has  multiple  controlling  clocks that are
  ESTABLISHED AT BIRTH.  By accessing one or more of these clocks,

							  Page 3





  one can  affect the mass under experiment to produce phenomena or
  changes that  are  temporarily   "independent"  of  the  external
  clocks.  Thus, through the use of magnetic, electric,  scalar  or
  other fields  of energy, (note here the KEY is FREQUENCY) one can
  alter the  mass  clock  for  phenomena  including,  time  shifts,
  dimensional shifts, levitation, local tapping of  "free"  energy,
  accelerated or    retarded   aging   of   material   to   produce
  embrittlement or greater strength of that material, etc.

  Bearing the above in mind, it follows that each element, being of
  a specific  frequency,  MUST resonate  IN  PHASE  with  the  same
  element, ANYWHERE  within  the Universe.  Now that  is  a  rather
  broad concept  and  so,  it should be amended to: each element of
  the same frequency will be in  phase  with  all other elements of
  the same  frequency  IN  ITS local energetic media.   This  again
  follows because  of  the  changes  in energy density in different
  regions of  space...and  such  changes  would  produce  not  only
  different "refractive indices" but also subject these frequencies
  to interference patterns from other frequency conflicts.

  We have  been looking for evidence that this principle  has  been
  tested but have not found anything which even specifies the above
  contentions.  It  is  a  difficult  matter to test because of the
  very nature of the machines used  to  detect  the frequencies and
  phase of  different  elements.   The NMR uses a 10KGauss  biasing
  field which  necessarily  SKEWS  the  phase  angle of the element
  under test.

  So, using two calibrated NMR  machines  over  a  distance,  would
  yield the SAME PHASE, thus nullifying the purpose of the test. If
  there was a means of testing that did not use such  a  DISTORTING
  FIELD, then the following test would apply.

  The basic  test  is  quite simple and involves two samples of the
  same element, located miles (or  preferably  hundreds  of  miles)
  from each other.  Each element is subjected to monitoring  by two
  calibrated instruments  to  determine  if  the phase DOES IN FACT
  remain the same over distance.   If  this  is proven to be so, it
  shows some  kind  of  controlling  clock  and  again   leads   to
  interesting machine possibilities.

  The point here is the potato RESTED ON THE 7TH DAY, why?  It must
  have picked  up  some  kind  of  NULL  zone,  created  as  a BEAT
  FREQUENCY BETWEEN DIFFERENT CLOCKING FREQUENCIES!
